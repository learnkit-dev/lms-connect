# Getting started

## Installation
```bash
composer require learnkit/lms-connect
```

## Enable the plugin for specific teams
You can enable the plugin for specific teams, so the installation of this package does not automatically grant access to all teams.
<procedure title="Enable the plugin for a team">
<step>Go to team settings</step>
<step>Click on the "Plugins" tab</step>
<step>Enable the "Connect Plugin"</step>
<step>Save the form</step>
</procedure>

## Obtaining an API key
You need an active API key to use the API. See [Registering API token](Authentication.md#register-api-token) for more information about getting one.

## Availability
The LMS plugin is only available to our enterprise users and can be installed only on version `>=3.5`.

## Support
If you have any questions about using the API or need more functionality to be added, please just email us at [support@cursuskit.nl](mailto:support@cursuskit.nl).

> You need a valid license to install and use the lms-connect plugin. It's an extension for the CursusKit LMS.
